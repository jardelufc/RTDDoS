TCPDUMP CONFIGURATION
---------------------
Tcpdump was started with the command:

	tcpdump -s 66000 -F options -w <datafile>

where <datafile> is the name of the dump file.

The "-s 66000" flag is to make sure we capture all the packet contents. 

The "-F options" flag causes tcpdump to read its filtering 
expression from the file called options which contains the following string:
 
	not host 192.168.0.10 and not (host 192.168.1.1 and port tftp) 
	and not src host 192.168.0.60

With these options, we wanted to ignore the following sessions:
- All packets to and from the host at 192.168.0.10.
  This is a Solaris box on the net from which we are controlling
  the outside traffic generator through an x-window session.

- All packets from the host at 192.168.0.6.
  This is a Solaris box on the test network that is not involved with the
  actual simulation, but is used for development. We wanted to ignore any
  random traffic coming from this machine.

- Any traffic between the router at 192.168.1.1 and a tftp port.
  Our router was generating some noise that we wanted to
  filter out.
