1.0 Overview
-------------
List files specify sessions which must be scored by
intrusion detection systems.  Separate list files
are provided for audit data collected using Sun's Basic
Security Monitoring (BSM) software and for raw packet
data collected using tcpdump. 
Each line in a list file corresponds to a separate session.
Each session corresponds to an individual TCP/IP connection between
two computers. For TCP sessions, this extends from 
the beginning of the initial three-message handshake 
to the final FIN and ACK sequence that closes the connection.
A session can be short for services such as finger, or
long for services such as telnet. Sessions can also
correspond to services that use TCP or UDP protocols.
A session is uniquely specified by the start time, by the source and
destination IP addresses, and by the source and destination ports.

The first nine columns in list files provide
information which identifies the TCP/IP connection.
The performance of intrusion detection systems will be evaluated 
using scores assigned to the tenth column.  
Each Score is a number which represents
how likely it is that an attack occurred in a particular session.
More positive numbers indicate that an attack was more likely.
Sessions can thus be ordered by scores to find those sessions where
attacks are most probable.
The tenth column must be filled in for every session. 
Best performance will be provided by systems which assign scores that
are monotonically related to the the 
posterior probability of an attack occurring in a session. 
The last column is optional, and can be
filled with an attack name.  A list of attack names in this sample set
is provided below.

The score and attack name columns will be provided already filled
in for sample and training data. They provide session labels for this
data which can be used to train intrusion detection systems and improve
algorithms.  The score column will contain zero or one to
indicate whether an attack occurred and the name column will contain
the name of an attack or a dash.  The score and attack name
columns will contain no information for test data, but must be filled
in and returned for scoring. The score column will contain 0.0
and the name column will contain a dash for test data when it is
delivered.

Sessions in list files will not include all TCP/IP connections that occur in a
simulation, but only those connections that must be scored. Some services and
sessions that are not involved in attacks will be ignored.
In addition, the number of sessions will be different in 
tcpdump and BSM list files because BSM audit data only captures 
TCP/IP connections that impinge on the workstation running BSM, 
while the tcpdump data captures connections between all internal and
outside machines during the simulation. In general, there will thus be
many more sessions in the tcpdump list file than in the BSM list file.


2.0 TCPDUMP Sample List File
---------------------
The following shows a sample tcpdump list file as it should be returned for
analysis, after the attack scores and optional attack names have
been filled in. In this simulation, there were two workstations
on an inside local network on the inside of a router (IP addresses 192.168.0.20
and 192.168.0.40), one workstation on the outside of the 
router (IP address 192.168.1.30), and BSM auditing was running 
on one of the inside workstations (IP address 192.168.0.20).
The tcpdump list file only includes TCP/IP connections that go between
inside and outside workstations that would be captured by a sniffer located
on the outside of the router.

The three sessions with the highest scores 
are the SMTP session starting at 06:04:36, the
telnet session starting at 05:04:43, and the login session starting at
22:57:53.  The telnet session is presumed to contain an attack named
"guess" with a score of 9.42, the SMTP session contains an
unnamed attack with a score of 12.0 , and the login
session contains an unnamed attack with a score of 7.0.

3.0 BSM Sample List File
---------------------
The following is a sample list file for BSM data corresponding to the same 
simulation used to obtain the tcpdump list file.
Formats of the BSM and tcpdump list files are identical.
The BSM list file has fewer sessions that the tcpdump list file because it
only includes TCP/IP connections impinging on the workstation
running BSM (IP address 192.168.0.20). Session numbers in both files (the first
number in each row) uniquely identify each session. Some
sessions (e.g. 1, 2, 7, 11) are in both the BSM and tcpdump list files
because they correspond to TCP/IP connections that affect both audit and 
sniffing data while other sessions are only in one list file 
because they correspond to TCP/IP connections
that are visible only in either the
audit or the sniffing data.  

Scores in the BSM list file do not have to be identical to 
scores for  sessions with the same index in the tcpdump list file.
Participants in the upcoming evaluation will be expected provide scores
generated by running intrusion detection systems under three conditions. 
In the first "BSM only" condition, scores will be reported using 
the BSM list file when only BSM audit data 
is provided as input to an intrusion detection system. 
In the second "tcpdump only" condition, scores will be reported 
using the tcpdump list file when only tcpdump packet sniffer data 
is provided as input to an intrusion detection system. 
In the final "combined" condition, scores will be 
reported using a combined list file where both BSM audit data 
and tcpdump data are provided as input to an intrusion detection system.
The combined list file will be created by including all lines from the
BSM and tcpdump list file and eliminating lines corresponding to the same 
sessions.

4.0 BSM and tcpdump Times and Dates 
-----------------------------------
Start dates and times in tcpdump list files are from tcpdump data as
created on an external sniffer workstation. These times will differ
from times recorded in BSM list files due to the latency of packet
transmission and processing and because clocks on the sniffer and on
the audit workstation are not guaranteed to be synchronized and will drift.
In the above sample list files this difference was assumed to be 
roughly 20 seconds. This temporal drift should be accounted for
when combining tcpdump and BSM data in intrusion detection systems.
Combining this data should be relatively easy because
a unique session number identifies BSM and tcpdump data corresponding
to each session.


5.0 Column Descriptions for list files
----------------------------------------
The columns in the list file contain the following:
Column 1: Unique session index.

Column 2: Starting date for the session in mm/dd/yyyy format as 
	  produced by the UNIX command
		date '+%m/%d/%Y'.
	  For example, 01/27/1998.
   	  Months range from 1 to 12, days start at 1, years 
   	  have four digits.
	  Note that the dates in tcpdump and BSM data may differ near 
	  day boundaries because times in tcpdump and BSM data 
	  can differ by as much as +/- 15 minutes and this time offset may
	  drift across the sessions by a small amount.

Column 3: Starting time for the session in hh:mm:ss format as
	  produced by the UNIX command
		date '+%H:%M:%S'.
	  For example, 09:54:18.
	  This time uses a 24 hour clock. Hours range from 0 to 23, 
	  minutes range from 0 to 59, and seconds range from 0 to 59.
	  Note that times in BSM data may be differ from times in tcpdump
	  data by as much as +/- 15 minutes and that this time offset may
	  drift across the sessions by a small amount.

Column 4: Duration of the session in hh:mm:ss format.
		  For example, 123:59:34.
		  Hours start at 0 and have no upper limit, minutes range from 
		  0 to 59, and seconds range from 0 to 59.

Column 5: Service name used by this session. A list of most of the
		  well-known ports and associated services that will be used 
		  in intrusion detection evaluations is available at
		  http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers
		  as well as in many books. This service name is provided
		  for convenience because the port numbers are also provided.
		  The service given is assumed to be tcp.  For UDP services, 
		  a "/u" is placed after the service name. For example,
		  in the above BSM list file the tftp service uses UDP and
		  is labeled as tftp/u.

Column 6: The source port for this session.

Column 7: The destination port for this session. 

Column 8: The source IP address for this session.

Column 9: The destination IP address for this session.

Column 10: The score assigned to a session which indicates how likely
		  an attack was in a session. More positive scores indicate that
		  an attack is more likely. 
		  For test data, this will be set to zero and must be filled
		  in using the output of an intrusion detection system
		  and returned for scoring. For training and sample data it will
		  be set to 1.0 or 0.0 to label each session and specify if an attack 
		  occurred.

Column 11: The optional attack name. For training and sample data this
		   will be filled in with the name of an attack. For test data,
		   this can optionally be filled in, if the intrusion detection
		   system can determine the attack type. If the intrusion detection
		   system does not determine the attack type, enter a dash.


6.0 Attack Names for Sample Data 
---------------------------------
The sample data contains only simple attacks which are included to
illustrate how intrusion detection systems will be scored.  They are
not necessarily representative of the attacks that will be included
in the training and test data. Most of the attacks in the 
sample data fail.  A session is labeled as containing an
attack if it contains any component of an attack. A session is also
labeled as containing an attack, even if the attack is unsuccessful and
fails.  Attacks include instances where a remote user illegally obtains
local user-level privileges or local root-level privileges on a
target machine and also instances where a remote user surveys a
potential target for weaknesses or searches for potential targets.
Attacks in the sample data include the following:

Name		Description
------		-------------
guess		Remote user guesses many passwords to log into a target machine
ping-sweep	Low level ICMP ping sweep to identify target machines
port-scan	Determine which services on a target machine are active
phf		Run Unix command line on a web server
rlogin		Rlogin to target machine without a password
rsh		Execute a command on the target machine without a password
rcp		Remotely copy a file to/from target machine without a password
