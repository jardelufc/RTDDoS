BSM CONFIGURATION
-----------------
The subdirectory CONFIG/bsm contains the bsm configuration files 
from the server that was attacked during this simulation. 
The following files are copied from /etc/security:
	audit_class
	audit_control
	audit_event
	audit_startup
	audit_user 

These configuration files are fairly standard, except for 
the "audit_startup" script.  This was modified to ensure that 
the following processes were audited: sendmail, inetd, cron, and rpcbind.

In addition, there are two scripts, "reset" and "killreset."  
These are the scripts that we used to start and stop the bsm auditing.  
Note that the "reset" scripts ends in an inifinite loop that appends 
the result of a "ps -elf" onto a file every 60 seconds.  
This was how we recorded the ps reults.


BUGS WITH PRAUDIT
-----------------
The praudit program core dumps when the complete bsm 
file is converted using 

   praudit alpha_release.1.0.bsm > before_with_crash.praudit &

The core dump is caused by a class fm event of type AUE_IOCTL.

To get an almost complete praudit file we did the following: 

1. Get everything up to 1 second before the crash
   auditreduce -b 19980123170433 alpha_release.1.0.bsm > before.bsm
   praudit before.bsm > before.praudit

2. Get everything after the crash
auditreduce -a 19980123170434 alpha_release.1.0.bsm > after.bsm
praudit after.bsm > after.praudit

3. Get the crash
auditreduce -a 19980123170433 -b 19980123170434 alpha_release.1.0.bsm > during.bsm

4. Get the crash but leave out the fm class events to prevent praudit
   from core dumping.

auditreduce -c no,fr,fw,fa,fc,fd,cl,pc,nt,ip,na,ad,lo,ap,io,ex,ot during.bsm\
		| praudit > during_exect_fm.praudit

5. Now edit each file to get rid of the extra file lines at the beginning and
ends and cat the pieced together. This will be
missing some fm class events like chmod, but no execs or forks or other
things that should be important. It 
would be a lot more work to pull out the other fm events excluding AUE_IOCTL 
because this isn't easy to do with praudit.
