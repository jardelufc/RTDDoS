 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
 	In these days, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the main threats for network connected computers. This way, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), that are systems for  detection of DDoS attacs trough the identification malicious packages, are a fundamental tool for protecting servers or hosts against the these threats. The present work aims at the study, implementation and validation of a DDoS attack detection framework, recently published this year in a scientifically recognized journal. The framework has been tested and validated, by using two databases (Data Mining and DARPA) of DDoS attacks, in which our framework has obtained high performance, measured terms of accuracy rate, as of 100\% of correctness identification for both databases.
